👋 Hi, I’m @ChrisDavi3s 
You've stumbled on my project page. Heres a quick overview: 

🌡️ CO2/Weatherstation
- An ESP32 based weatherstation using an eink display such that the whole device can be used on battery (The ESP32 supports deep sleep states). Also want to implement a NDIR CO2 monitor, and temperature and humidity sensors. Very WIP but exams :(

❤️ Arduino EKG:
- An arduino based hear rate monitor with a python front end. 

🥼 Python for labs
- Snippets of code I always forget. Please find here an example of my work submitted.


Todo:
-Upload lamp code
-Upload more weather station code
-Actually lean how to use git properly so I dont have to do this manually uhh

This is all a WIP but I hope some of this makes sense. Thanks for looking!
