Looking for my diss...

üå°Ô∏è CO2/Weatherstation
- An ESP32 based weatherstation using an eink display such that the whole device can be used on battery (The ESP32 supports deep sleep states). Also want to implement a NDIR CO2 monitor, and temperature and humidity sensors. Very WIP because exams :(

‚ù§Ô∏è Arduino EKG:
- An arduino based hear rate monitor with a python front end. 

ü•º Python for labs
- Snippets of code I always forget. Please find here an example of my work submitted.

‚õàÔ∏èThunderLamp
- An LED lamp that has LIGHTNING!

Todo:
-Upload lamp code
-Upload more weather station code
-Actually lean how to use git properly so I dont have to do this manually uhh

This is all a WIP but I hope some of this makes sense. I've never formally been taught any code so a lot of this is very much a mess. Thanks for looking!
